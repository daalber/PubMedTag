# PubMedTag

## This is a python script which facilitates tagging of studies for literature reviews

Specifically, using a spreadsheet of the same format generated by PubMedToSheet (see my other repos):

1) Studies are tagged with keywords/phrases

2) Tags are each unique columns (i.e. if two studies are tagged with "word" both are marked in the same column. This makes them sortable!)

3) The spreadsheet is saved along with a list of unique tags, and a previously edited spreadsheet/list of tags can be imported. That way, you can take a break instead of tagging the 10's/100's/1000's of articles in one sitting.
